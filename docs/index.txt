# Open Mfantse Community


**Mfantse** (/m'fan'tse/), also known as Fantse or Fante, is one of the three principal members of the Akan dialect continuum, along with Asante and Akuapem, the latter two collectively known as Twi, with which it is mutually intelligible. It is principally spoken in the central and southern regions of Ghana as well as in settlements in other regions in western Ghana, Ivory Coast, as well as in Liberia, Gambia and Angola.

## About Us

The project is made up of three apps: `Adzesua`, `Nkasafua` and `Adowno`.

**Adzesua** is the Mfantse language `learning app` that contains lessons from beginner to advanced students. Adzesua makes extensive of the English language to help learning easily pick up new words and progress quickly. Adzesua is a learning toolbox and contains all topics and lessons being taught in Ghanaian schools at the basic, junior and senior high levels.

**Nkasafua** is the Mfantse language `dictionary app`. It contains all words used in the Mfantse lanaguge and their definitions, word class, example usage in simple sentences, etc.

**Adowno** was the `priestly book` of `Osofo Egya Ahor`, a chief priest of Mfantseman, who lived around the 12th century BC.
