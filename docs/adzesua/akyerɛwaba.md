The Mfantse Alphabets


## Nyienyim

There are 22 original and 2 borrowed alphabets used in the Mfantse Language.
The letters (Jj & Ll) were recently borrowed into the language to cater for the 
use of foreign words which have gained wide range usage and acceptance among the
Mfantse people. Words such as Jesus, Judea, lɔre (lorry) and many others have recently
been borrowed and accepted into the Mfantse Language.

The following are the 24 letters (known as ``akyerɛwaba``) of the Mfantse Language:
