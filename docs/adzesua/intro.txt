Learn Mfantse Language


## Nyienyim (Prelude)

The Mfantse is group of languages (with very close resemblance) spoken mainly by the Borbor, Etsi, Agona, Ahanta and Wassa.
It must also be noted that the majority of Nzemas speak the Mfantse Language.

Borbor is made of Kurentsi, Ajumako, Enyan, Essiam, Nkusukum, Ekumfi, and Gomoa.
Etsi is also made of Asebu, Oguaa (Fetu), Afutu, Awutu, Senya, Edina Eguafo, Komenda, and Shama.
The people within these communities and their surroundings are generally reffered to as Mfantsefo.

The official Mfantse Language studied in Ghanaian schools is a unified version of all these languages. Words are borrowed from all the various Mfantse dialects.

However, it is worth noting that choices of words in written Mfantse adowno are mostly influenced by the native language of the writer. For instance, a Gomoa writer 
will write ``otu`` for **gun**, whiles the Fetu writer will spell it as ``etu``. However, the unified Mfantse word for **gun** is ``itsur``.


## Abakɔsɛm (History)

By the time the Bono separatists, Borbor, nicknamed Fa-atsew reached Mankessim, the territory was already inhabited by the Etsi.

The Borbor spoke a variant of Bono (an Akan language mainly spoken by the people of Techiman and the surrounding communities), and the Etsi spoke the Guan language.
After centuries of interactions and intermarriages, a new form of language developed, and that is what we now know as the Mfantse language. 
Under the umbrella of the Mfantse tradition, Etsi is recognized as the elder because they were the first to occupy the Mfantse territory. 
The Ahanta were also part of the Bono separatists.

In time, other separatists from other Akan communities also settled in territories now known as Breman and Agona 
close to the Bono Borbor separatists, sharing boundaries with Ajumako and Gomoa. Similarly, after years of coexistence, the Mfantse-Agona language developed.

The Bureau of Ghana Languages (BGL), is the authority behind the unified Mfantse language, and other Ghanaian languages studied in Ghanaian schools.
